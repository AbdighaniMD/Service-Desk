# **Incident report**

## About 
After a series of productive email exchanges with Jenna from GreenScape Landscaping, you successfully identified and resolved the issue preventing access to their email account. The root cause was found to be a browser-specific problem, where an outdated browser cache and cookies interfered with the login process. By guiding Jenna to clear the browser's cache and cookies and then attempting to access the email through an incognito window, you not only resolved the issue but also provided a preventive measure for avoiding similar problems in the future.

### Completing the incident report
Now, it's time to document the issue and resolution process in an incident report. This report is crucial for providing a record of the problem, the steps taken to resolve it, and any follow-up actions or recommendations. Here's how to complete your incident report:

- **Outcome and follow-up**
