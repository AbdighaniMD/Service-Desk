# **GreenScape's email access issue**

**Ticket #54321** - GreenScape Landscaping Email Access Issue
**Submitted by:** Jenna Marshall, Office Manager, GreenScape Landscaping

## Issue description:
Good morning,

We're currently unable to access our main email account (support@greenscapelandscaping.com), which severely impacts our operations. The login page simply refreshes each time we attempt to sign in without any error message. This issue started late yesterday, and we haven't made any changes to our account settings or passwords recently. We urgently need this resolved so we can continue our daily communications with clients and suppliers.

Thank you,
Jenna

Dear Jenna,

Good morning! I hope this message finds you well. My name is Abdighani, and I'm with the Datacom services team. I've received your ticket regarding the difficulties you're experiencing with accessing the support@greenscapelandscaping.com email account. I understand how crucial email communication is for your operations, and I want to assure you that promptly resolving this issue is my top priority.

To help us pinpoint and resolve the issue as efficiently as possible, could you please provide a bit more information on the following:

1. __Browser and device use:__ Have you tried accessing your email on different browsers or devices? If so, did the issue persist across all of them?
2. __Recent changes:__ Although you mentioned no recent changes to account settings or the password, have there been any updates or changes to your internet service or security software?
3. __Error messages:__ While you noted the absence of an error message, it would be helpful to know about any other unusual behaviour or notifications during login attempts.

In the meantime, here are a few initial steps you can take that often resolve similar issues:

- __Clear your browser's cache and cookies:__ This can sometimes resolve loading issues with web pages.
- __Try a different browser or a private/incognito window:__ This can help us determine if the problem is related to browser settings.

I look forward to your response to the above questions. Rest assured, we will work together to resolve this as quickly as possible. 

Thank you for your cooperation and patience. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Abdighani MD
