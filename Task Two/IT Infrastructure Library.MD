# **IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) processes**

# About 
The IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a globally recognised framework of best practices for delivering efficient and effective IT services. Developed in the 1980s by the UK's Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), ITIL provides comprehensive guidance on the management of IT service processes, focusing on aligning IT services with business needs. The framework is structured around the service life cycle, which includes service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation, and continual service improvement.

## **Key principles of ITIL**
- __Service value system (SVS):__ 
ITIL 4 introduces the SVS, which emphasises the importance of creating value through IT services. The SVS includes guiding principles, governance, service value chain activities, practices, and continual improvement.
- __Four dimensions of service management:__
ITIL 4 also highlights four dimensions critical to the effective and balanced management of IT services: Organisations and People, Information and Technology, Partners and Suppliers, and Value Streams and Processes. These dimensions ensure a holistic approach to service management.

## **Incident management**

This ITIL process is focused on minimising the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operations as quickly as possible. Key steps in the incident management process include:

- __Incident identification and logging:__ Recording incidents as they are reported to ensure that all relevant details are captured.
- __Categorisation and prioritisation:__ Determining the nature of the incident and assigning a priority based on impact and urgency.
- __Initial diagnosis:__ Attempting to resolve the incident using available resources or knowledge.
- __Escalation (if required):__ Forwarding the incident to higher-level expertise when it cannot be resolved within the initial support tier.
- __Investigation and diagnosis:__ Thorough analysis by skilled technicians to identify the root cause.
- __Resolution and recovery:__ Implementing a solution to resolve the incident and restore service.
- __Incident closure:__ Once the service is restored and the user confirms the resolution, the incident will be formally closed.

### Benefits of ITIL for incident management and service requests

- __Improved efficiency:__ By standardising the approach to incident management and service requests, ITIL helps organisations resolve issues more quickly and efficiently.
- __Enhanced service quality:__ ITIL's best practices ensure that IT services are aligned with business needs, leading to higher quality and more reliable IT support.
- __Increased customer satisfaction:__ Effective incident and request management processes improve the overall user experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction.
