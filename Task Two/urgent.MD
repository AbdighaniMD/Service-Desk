# **Your support tickets**

# About
As the day begins at Datacom, your screen reveals a list of new support tickets. Each ticket is a call for help, but today, a critical issue casts a shadow over the rest: a network outage impacting not just one but several clients. It's your job to sift through these tickets, assess their impact and urgency, and ensure that the most critical issues are prioritised for swift resolution.

# Approach to the problem:

## **Categorisation of tickets:**

1. __Network outage issue__ (Tickets #001 and #002): These tickets report a complete loss of internet connectivity and access to cloud services, affecting all users within two separate organisations.
2. __Software installation request__ (Ticket #003): A request for installing new graphic design software to meet an upcoming project deadline.
3. __Password reset request__ (Ticket #004): An urgent need for a password reset to access critical financial documentation due today.
4. __Hardware malfunction report__ (Ticket #005): Reports a flickering laptop screen that severely hampers work on critical projects.

## **Develop your prioritisation plan:**

- __High priority:__ The network outage tickets (#001 and #002) are categorised as high priority due to their significant impact on the operations of two entire organisations, necessitating immediate action.
- __Medium priority:__ The hardware malfunction report (Ticket #005) is considered a medium priority. While it affects the productivity of one user, the issue could have broader implications if not addressed in a timely manner.
- __Low priority:__ The software installation (Ticket #003) and password reset requests (Ticket #004), despite their urgency from the user's perspective, are categorised as low priority compared to the network outage. These tickets are important but do not have the same widespread operational impact.

### Escalation and addressing the network outage:
For the high-priority network outage issue, immediate escalation to the network support team is necessary, following ITIL processes. This includes a detailed report of the issue, affected services, and any initial diagnostics. Communication with affected clients is crucial to inform them about the issue, ongoing actions for resolution, and estimated timeframes for service restoration.

### Justification of decisions:

The prioritisation was based on assessing the impact and urgency of each issue. The network outage was given the highest priority due to its extensive impact on business operations and the number of users affected. In contrast, individual requests for software installation and password resets, while urgent to the requesters, were categorised as lower priority in the context of overall business continuity. The hardware malfunction, affecting one user's ability to perform critical tasks, was considered a medium priority due to its potential to delay project timelines if not addressed promptly.

This prioritisation plan aims to efficiently allocate support resources to address the most critical issues first, ensuring the restoration of services for the greatest number of users while still planning for the timely resolution of less urgent tickets. The approach demonstrates an understanding of the need to balance impact, urgency, and resource availability in IT support operations.
