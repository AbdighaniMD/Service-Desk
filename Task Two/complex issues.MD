# **Techniques for escalating complex issues**

# About:
Escalating complex issues involves more than just passing a problem up the chain. It requires strategic thinking, clear communication, and a focus on customer experience. Here's how to approach escalation effectively.

1. Recognise the need for escalation:
- __Complexity beyond your scope:__ When an issue exceeds your technical knowledge or access.
- __Resource requirements:__ The issue requires more resources than currently available at your level.
- __Time sensitivity:__ The problem must be resolved quickly to avoid a significant impact on the client.

2. Prepare for escalation:
- __Comprehensive documentation:__ Ensure all information about the issue, including steps already taken, client interactions, and any diagnostic results, are thoroughly documented. This preparation is crucial for the next level of support to understand the issue without needing to retrace steps.
- __Client communication:__ Inform the client about the escalation process. Explain why it's necessary, what it involves, and how it benefits them, setting realistic expectations about resolution times and next steps.

3. Execute the escalation:
- __Select the appropriate channel:__ Use the designated escalation channel or tool your organisation has in place, whether it's a form, an internal system, or direct communication with a more specialised team.

- __Provide a clear summary:__ Summarise the issue, highlighting critical findings and why it's being escalated. Offer a hypothesis if you have one, but make it clear it's a suggestion, not a confirmed diagnosis.
- __Hand over with context:__ If possible, have a brief handover discussion with the team or individual taking over. This conversation can provide additional context that might not be fully captured in the documentation.

4. Follow-up and communication:
- __Stay informed:__ Keep track of the issue's progress after escalation. This might involve checking in with the higher-level support team or using your organisation's tracking tools.
- __Update the client:__ Regularly update the client on the status of their issue. Even if there's no new information, letting them know they haven't been forgotten improves the customer experience.

5. Learn from escalations:
- __Feedback loop:__ After resolution, review the escalation process. What worked well? What could be improved? This review can be done individually or as part of a team meeting.
- __Knowledge sharing:__ Share lessons learned with your team. If the resolution involved acquiring new knowledge, consider how this can be documented to help handle similar issues in the future without needing escalation.

**Additional considerations:**

- __Empathy and professionalism:__ Always maintain a professional demeanour and empathise with the client throughout the escalation process. Your role is to be their advocate and ensure their issue is resolved satisfactorily.
- __Continuous improvement:__ Use escalations as opportunities to continuously improve your knowledge base, processes, and personal development.
